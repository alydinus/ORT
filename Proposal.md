# Project Proposal: ORT Preparation Platform

## 1. Project Overview
The ORT Preparation Platform is a community\-driven educational web application designed to help students in Kyrgyzstan prepare for the National Standardized Test \(ORT\). It combines interactive learning, user\-generated content, and moderation to ensure quality educational materials — similar to the collaborative model of Wikipedia, but specialized for exam preparation.

## 2. Problem Statement
Currently, ORT preparation resources are fragmented across different websites and social media platforms. Students face difficulties finding reliable, localized, and structured content in one place. There is also a lack of community collaboration and quality control in existing solutions.

The proposed system solves this problem by:
- Providing a centralized platform for verified educational materials.
- Allowing students and teachers to contribute articles and practice questions.
- Ensuring content quality through a moderation workflow.

## 3. Project Goals
- Create a structured, accessible, and community\-driven platform for ORT preparation.
- Support learning articles, practice questions, and testing modules.
- Build a moderation system that maintains content integrity.
- Lay the foundation for AI\-based features such as instant feedback and question explanations.

## 4. Key Features \(MVP\)
| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| User Management | Registration, authentication \(JWT\), and user roles \(User, Moderator, Admin\). |
| Content System | Users can create and publish learning materials and test questions \(subject to moderation\). |
| Testing Module | Users can take practice tests and receive immediate results. |
| Moderation | Moderators review and approve user\-submitted content. |
| Community Interaction | Commenting system and article discussions. |
| Search and Categorization | Content organized by subjects: Math, Reading, Logic, etc. |

## 5. Future Enhancements
- AI\-powered explanations for wrong answers.
- Gamification: ranking, XP, achievements.
- Tutor marketplace and online payment system.
- Mobile application \(Flutter or Kotlin Multiplatform\).
- Full\-scale ORT simulation with time tracking and adaptive difficulty.

## 6. Target Users
| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| Guest | Can browse approved content only. |
| Student \(User\) | Can read articles, take tests, and submit new questions\/articles. |
| Moderator | Reviews and approves or rejects submitted content. |
| Administrator | Manages moderators and system settings. |

## 7. Technology Stack
| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Spring Boot \(Java\/Kotlin\) |
| Frontend | Vue.js or React \(with TailwindCSS\) |
| Database | PostgreSQL \(relational\) \+ MongoDB \(optional for flexible content\) |
| Auth | JWT\-based authentication |
| Deployment | Dockerized microservices \(Docker Compose → Kubernetes\) |
| Version Control \& CI\/CD | GitHub \+ GitHub Actions |

## 8. System Architecture \(Conceptual\)
- Frontend \(Vue\/React\) communicates with an API Gateway.
- API Gateway routes to services:
    - Auth Service → User DB
    - Content Service → Articles DB
    - Moderation Service → Sandbox Queue
    - Testing Service → Tests \& Results DB

## 9. Project Timeline \(Initial Phase\)
| Phase | Duration | Deliverables |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Requirements \& Design | 2 weeks | SRS, diagrams, database schema |
| 2. Backend MVP | 3 weeks | Auth \+ Content \+ Test APIs |
| 3. Frontend MVP | 3 weeks | Basic UI, article\/test pages |
| 4. Integration \& Testing | 2 weeks | Connected system, demo deployment |
| 5. Presentation \& Feedback | 1 week | Stakeholder demo, documentation |

## 10. Expected Impact
- Makes ORT preparation accessible and transparent.
- Encourages collaboration among students and educators.
- Builds a foundation for national\-level educational innovation in Kyrgyzstan.

## 11. Long\-Term Vision
- Evolve into a national learning ecosystem integrating:
    - AI\-driven tutoring and adaptive testing.
    - Verified tutor marketplace.
    - Cross\-platform access \(web, mobile, desktop\).
    - Kyrgyz and Russian language support.
